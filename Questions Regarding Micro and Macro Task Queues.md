# Conceptual Understanding:

What is the fundamental difference between microtasks and macrotasks?
Why do microtasks have higher priority over macrotasks in the event loop?
Can you provide an example of a microtask and a macrotask?
How does the existence of micro and macro task queues affect the order of execution in asynchronous code?
What are some potential benefits of separating micro and macro tasks?
Scenario-Based Questions:

**Consider the following code snippet:
JavaScript
console.log(1);
setTimeout(() => console.log(2), 0);
new Promise((resolve) => resolve()).then(() => console.log(3));
console.log(4);
Use code with caution.
content_copy
What will be the output order, and why?**
How would the output of the previous code snippet change if you used await instead of new Promise().then()?
Imagine you have a user interface that needs to update dynamically based on user interaction. How could micro and macro tasks be used to manage the responsiveness of the UI while handling asynchronous operations?
What are some potential drawbacks of relying heavily on microtasks?
Advanced Questions:

Explain the concept of task draining and how it relates to micro and macro tasks.
How do error handling mechanisms like try...catch interact with micro and macro task queues?
Can you describe any libraries or frameworks that leverage micro and macro tasks for specific purposes?
How might the existence of micro and macro tasks affect the performance optimization of asynchronous code?
